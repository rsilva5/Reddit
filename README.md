Multiple Tables with Reddit: CodeAcademy

For this project, you’ll be working as a Data Analyst who will be examining some fictional data from Reddit, a social news aggregation, content rating site.

On Reddit, users can create posts with content such as text, media, and links to other websites. Users can post content to different communities known as subreddits, which focus on a particular topic. Users can then rate others’ content by upvoting or downvoting them, and each post will show its total cumulative score.

For this task you were given three tables:

users: users data
posts: posts information
subreddits: information about subreddits
